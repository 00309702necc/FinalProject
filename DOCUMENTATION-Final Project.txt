Additonal Documentation for Final Project:

Instructions: Make sure the "database.txt" file is in the
project folder. Then, just run like normal.

Dependencies: Tkinter, os , hashlib , re .

Future Work: I would probably try and make the TKinter 
interface a bit more modern or I would maybe try a different
graphical UI library all together if I had more time. I want
to learn more about designing the UI and whatnot because it 
was interesting to learn about TKinter.

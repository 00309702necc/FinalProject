Andrew Caron-DiPietro #00309702- Programming for IT

Description of project: 

My project will consist of a login using python that will help us to integrate into our system. 
I will use regular expressions to check that we are entering a valid user and I will use encryption to encrypt our passwords for users.
Finally, I will also use a text file as a database for the users in the system.


Completion Statement: I met all requirements during this project. TKinter was confusing at first but I eventually got it. 
The other aspects of this project were all elements that we already had used throughout the semester, it was just a matter
of piecing it all together for the final project.

Statement of Assistance: For the TKinter part of the project, I used lots of YouTube video tutorials
to help me get acustomed to TKinter and how it operates. The TKinter was really the only part of this
project that I had extensive difficulty with.
